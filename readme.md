## Reflection

During development, I discovered that designing for large screens first — as opposed to a mobile-first approach — can encourage more creative and expressive layout ideas. Mobile design tends to follow a more linear and constrained structure, which makes it easier to adapt a large-screen layout down to mobile, rather than the other way around.


> ✨ Clean design. Clear message. Curiously engaging.
